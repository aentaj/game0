Game0 => Solar PV Dev.
11022020

This is a tile based game which is built on Solar PV development.
The main goal of this game is to enable MMO players to gradually develop Solar PV Plants which would feed various structures.
The Solar PV Plants are fed again by the output of various structures in the form of more advanced materials, management and R&D.
The chain of development of Solar PV plants and other structures is designed in a non-linear manner.
Non-linear games usually give players more fun and experience.

The Non-linear structure is basically designed as follows:
1- Players start with a certain amount of resources and HQ.
2- Resources are basically used to build basic resource structures such as: Farms, Training Facilities, (Silicon Aluminum Iron and Dopant refineries)
3- These 3 basic facilities are then used to improve each other in a certain fun pattern which can be elastic, meaning different priorities result in different outputs and development chain.
    For example, once Training Facilities are developed faster, a more (refined Solar PV design is achieved). While when Resources are developed earlier, a (refined Solar PV material are achieved).
